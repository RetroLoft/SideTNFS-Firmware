 * Only meant to prove network reachability (visible via tcpdump on the
 * server) without touching GEMDRIVE or its timing.

// Fase 5B: create a UDP PCB and udp_connect() it to the TNFS server, then
// immediately remove it again. Sends no payload at all -- udp_connect() is a
// local lwIP operation (sets the PCB's remote ip/port filter) and does not
// put anything on the wire. Must only be called after WiFi is confirmed
// connected. Never blocks, never retries, never waits for a reply, never
// logs. Returns true if the PCB was created and udp_connect() succeeded.

// Fase 5A: send a single UDP packet to the TNFS server. Kept for reference;
// not called automatically as of Fase 5B. Must only be called after WiFi is
// confirmed connected. Never blocks, never retries, never waits for a
// reply, never logs. Silently does nothing on any failure.

// Fase 5C/5F: send a single TNFS MOUNT request and register a receive
// callback for the (optional, asynchronous) reply. Fire-and-forget -- never
// waits, never retries, never logs. Must only be called after WiFi is
// confirmed connected. Marks the debug state dirty so
// sidetnfs_debug_file_service() will pick this up on its next call.

// Fase 5F: if the debug state is dirty (mount probe just sent, or a
// response just arrived) and hd_folder is known, (re)write
// <hd_folder>/DEBUG.TXT with FA_CREATE_ALWAYS, then clear the dirty flag.
// No-op (and stays dirty for a later call) if hd_folder is NULL, nothing is
// dirty, or the last write was too recent (simple throttling). Never
// blocks, never retries, silently does nothing on any failure. Safe to
// call from multiple places, including once per GEMDRIVE main-loop
// iteration -- the dirty-check keeps it a cheap no-op otherwise.
